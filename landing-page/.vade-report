### 2. Analytics Component Configuration ✓
- File: app/[locale]/layout.tsx
- Import: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';`
- Placement: `<Analytics />` component is properly placed inside the `<body>` tag

```typescript
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';

export default async function LocaleLayout({ children, params }) {
  // ... layout code ...
  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <NextIntlClientProvider messages={messages}>
          <ThemeProvider>
            <Header />
            {children}
            <Footer />
            <ThemeSwitcher />
          </ThemeProvider>
          <Analytics />
        </NextIntlClientProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Verification Results

### Build Status ✓
- Build completed successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- All routes compiled without issues

### Lint Status ✓
- No ESLint warnings or errors

### Package Manager
- Using: npm
- Lock file: package-lock.json (updated)

## Files Modified

## Files Already Configured (No Changes Needed)
- package.json (already contains @vercel/analytics dependency)
- app/[locale]/layout.tsx (already has Analytics component properly integrated)

## Notes
The Vercel Web Analytics was already properly configured in this project. The only change made was updating the package-lock.json file by running npm install to ensure all dependencies are properly installed and the lock file is up to date.

The implementation follows Next.js App Router best practices:
- Analytics component imported from '@vercel/analytics/next'
- Placed in the root layout file
- Positioned inside the body tag after main content
- This ensures analytics tracking is available across all pages in the application
